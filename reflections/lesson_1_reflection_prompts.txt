How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Itâ€˜s much easier to find the difference between versions using a diff tool.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    easy to revert to old version, easy to compare between specific versions.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    manually choosing 
        pros:
        I can choose when to commit which changes
        cons:
        some changes may commit too big or small, or forget to commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    contents which have logic connections should be commit together, eg. a bug fix may impact more than one file, then we can commmit multiple files together as a whole logic change.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log to show the logs of each commits.
    git diff to compare two specific commit which is identified by a hash code.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Everything you have changed is stored in version control system, we can revert at any time if there is something wrong.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
